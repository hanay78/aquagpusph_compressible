/** @class SetTabFile SetTabFile.h CalcServer/SetTabFile.h
 * @brief Particles set runtime output.
 *
 * A runtime output is an output which is created during the code execution,
 * featured by:
 *    -# Low amount of involved memory
 *    -# Relatively low computational cost
 * Thus, it can be safely computed and printed quite often
 *
 * This tool is printing the selected properties of a set of particles in a
 * tabulated file with the following columns:
 *    - Time instant
 *    - First particle, first property
 *    - First particle, second property
 *    - ...
 *    - First particle, last property
 *    - Second particle, first property
 *    - ...
 *    - Second particle, last property
 *    - ...
 *    - Last particle, first property
 *    - ...
 *    - Last particle, last property
 *
 * And therefore \f$ n_{prop} \cdot n_{parts} \f$ fields should be doownloaded
 * and printed in plain text. Please, be extremely careful about the considered
 * particles set and fields
