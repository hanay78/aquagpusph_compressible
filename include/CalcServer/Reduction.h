     * @param operation The reduction operation.
     * For instance:
     *   - "c += b;"
     *   - "c.x = (a.x < b.x) ? a.x : b.x; a.y = (a.y < b.y) ? a.y : b.y;"

     * float min value reduction, or (vec2)(0.f,0.f) for a 2D vec sum reduction.
     * @param once Run this tool just once. Useful to make initializations.
     * @note Some helpers are available for null_val:
     *   - VEC_ZERO: Zeroes vector.
     *   - VEC_ONE: Ones vector, in 3D cases the last component will be zero.
     *   - VEC_ALL_ONE: Equal to VEC_ONE, but in 3D cases the last component will be one as well.
     *   - VEC_INFINITY: INFINITY components vector, in 3D cases the last component will be zero.
     *   - VEC_ALL_INFINITY: Equal to VEC_INFINITY, but in 3D cases the last component will be INFINITY as well.
     *   - VEC_NEG_INFINITY: -VEC_INFINITY
     *   - VEC_ALL_NEG_INFINITY: -VEC_ALL_INFINITY.
