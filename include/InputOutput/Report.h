 * In AQUAgpusph the input/output managers are divided in 3 different types:
 *   -# The simulation configuration files manager
 *   -# The report file managers
 *   -# The particles output file managers
 *
 * The reports are just output files that are relatively low hard disk
 * demanding.
 *
 * This class allows the inherited ones to force the output file name (see
 * file(const char* filename)) or to look the first file name which is not
 * already existing in the system (see
 * file(const char* basename, unsigned int startindex)).
