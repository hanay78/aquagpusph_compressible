/** @class FastASCII FastASCII.h InputOutput/FastASCII.h
 * @brief Plain text particles data files loader/saver.
 *
 * These files are formatted as ASCCI plain text where the particles data are
 * stored by rows, and where the fields are separated by columns.
 *
 * @note Comments are allowed using the symbol `"#"`, such that all the text
 * after this symbol, and in the same line, will be discarded.
 * The fields can be separated by the following symbols:
 *   - `" "`
 *   - `","`
 *   - `";"`
 *   - `"("`
 *   - `")"`
 *   - `"["`
 *   - `"]"`
 *   - `"{"`
 *   - `"}"`
 *   - tabulator
 * @remarks In the case of integer numbers (signed or unsigned) this class does
 * not care about decimal points, just truncating the value, i.e. 1.5 will be
 * interpreted as 1, and -1.5 will be interpreted as -1.
 * @warning Saving the particles data in plain text format may be heavily hard
 * disk demanding, and therefore it is strongly recommended to consider binary
 * formats like Aqua::InputOutput::VTK.
