 * \brief Simple but versatile singleton instance (Meyers singleton).
 *
 * The singletons are instances that can be accessed everywhere even though it
 * has not been passed as argument.
 *
 * To create a singleton instance just define the class as an inherited of this
 * one:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
    #include <Singleton.h>
    class MyClass : public Aqua::Singleton<MyClass>
    {
        ...
    };
   @endcode
 *
 * Then you can access your class everywhere you want (please, don't forget to
 * include your class header):
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
    MyClass *c = MyClass::singleton();
   @endcode
 *
 * @warning This implementation will not support multithreading.
