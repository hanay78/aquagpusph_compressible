/** @brief Set the mass of the particles according to their gamma value.
 *
 * When a particle is split in a set of daughter particles, in order to avoid
 * shocks, its effect is smoothly transfered to the daughters, using for that a
 * \f$ \gamma_m \f$ mass multiplier.
 *
 * @param imove Moving flags.
 *   - imove > 0 for regular fluid/solid particles.
 *   - imove = 0 for sensors.
 *   - imove < 0 for boundary elements/particles.
 * @param m0 Target mass, \f$ m_0 \f$. When a particle is split/coalesced, its
 * mass is progressively transfered to its children.
 * @param miter Mass transfer iteration (Positive for growing particles,
 * negative for shrinking particles).
 * @param m Current mass \f$ m \f$.
 * @param N Number of particles.
