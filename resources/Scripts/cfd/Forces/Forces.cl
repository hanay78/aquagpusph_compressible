/** @brief Tool to compute the force and moment of each particle.
 *
 * In this approach, since the global force and motion is looked for, the force
 * is computed as:
 * \f$$ f_a = - m_a \cdot \left(
 *   \frac{d \mathbf{u}}{d t} - \mathbf{g} \right) \f$$
 * And the moment as:
 * \f$$ f_a = - m_a \cdot \mathbf{r}_0 \times \left(
 *   \frac{d \mathbf{u}}{d t} - \mathbf{g} \right) \f$$
 *
 * @param forces_f Force of each particle to be computed [N].
 * @param forces_m Moment of each particle to be computed
 * [N \f$ \cdot \f$ m].
 * @param imove Moving flags.
 *   - imove > 0 for regular fluid particles.
 *   - imove = 0 for sensors.
 *   - imove < 0 for boundary elements/particles.
 * @param r Position \f$ \mathbf{r} \f$.
 * @param dudt Velocity rate of change
 * \f$ \frac{d \mathbf{u}}{d t} \f$.
 * @param m Mass \f$ m \f$.
 * @param N Number of particles.
 * @param g Gravity acceleration \f$ \mathbf{g} \f$.
 * @param forces_r Point with respect the moments are computed
 * \f$ \mathbf{r}_0 \f$.
