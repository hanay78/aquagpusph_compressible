/** @brief Velocity extension for the computation of the Laplacian of the
 * velocity.
 *
 * For the Laplacian of the velocity, the normmal velocity is taken from the
 * mirroring interpolated value (SSM), while the tangential velocity is taken
 * directly from the body motion (U0M).
 *
 * In the thesis of Benjamin Bouscasse the tangential velocity is asymetrically
 * extended (ASM). However it is producing unphysical results.
 *
 * Herein the density is also got from the mirroring interpolated value (SSM)
 *
 * @param imove Moving flags.
 *   - imove > 0 for regular fluid particles.
 *   - imove = 0 for sensors.
 *   - imove < 0 for boundary elements/particles.
 * @param associations Mirroring particles.
 * @param normal Normal \f$ \mathbf{n} \f$.
 * @param gp_rho Interpolated density in the mirrored position \f$ \rho \f$.
 * @param gp_u Interpolated velocity in the mirrored position \f$ \mathbf{u} \f$.
 * @param rho Density \f$ \rho \f$.
 * @param u Velocity \f$ \mathbf{u} \f$.
 * @param N Number of particles.
