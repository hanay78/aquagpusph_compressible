/** @brief Velocity extension for the computation of the Laplacian of the
 * velocity, when free-slip should be enforced.
 *
 * In this case, both the normal and the tangential velocities are taken from
 * the mirroring interpolated value (SSM).
 *
 * Herein the density is also got from the mirroring interpolated value (SSM)
 *
 * @param iset Set of particles index.
 * @param imove Moving flags.
 *   - imove > 0 for regular fluid particles.
 *   - imove = 0 for sensors.
 *   - imove < 0 for boundary elements/particles.
 * @param associations Mirroring particles.
 * @param gp_u Interpolated velocity in the mirrored position \f$ \mathbf{u} \f$.
 * @param u Velocity \f$ \mathbf{u} \f$.
 * @param N Number of particles.
 * @param freeslip_iset Particles set which should be considered free-slip.
