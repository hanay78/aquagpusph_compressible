<!-- Control of the number of neighbours. This tool can be useful to both,
control the number of neighbours of each particle, as well as avoiding that
a set of clamped particles may hangs your computer.

To use this preset, just include this file (it's strongly recommended to include
it as the last module), and eventually set maximum number of neighbours per
particle, "neighs_limit".

<Include file="Presets/basic/neighsLimit.xml" />
<Variables>
    <Variable name="neighs_limit" type="float" value="2.0 * (3.0 * support * hfac)^dims" />
</Variables>

The expression above allows twice more neighbours than the expectable ones (the
default value).
